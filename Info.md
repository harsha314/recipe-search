Excellent choice! Combining Elasticsearch with Spring Boot is a very practical and common real-world use case. Spring Data Elasticsearch provides a great abstraction layer, making it much easier to interact with Elasticsearch from a Spring application.

Here's a beginner-friendly project idea, followed by open-source datasets you can use:

Beginner's Project: Spring Boot Recipe Search Engine
Concept: Build a Spring Boot application that allows users to search, filter, and view recipes. This project covers core Spring Boot concepts (REST APIs, Spring Data) and essential Elasticsearch features (indexing, full-text search, filtering, aggregations).

Why it's good for beginners:

Relatable Domain: Recipes are something most people understand, making it easy to grasp the data and search requirements.

Structured Data: Recipes have clear fields (title, ingredients, instructions, cooking time, cuisine, diet tags), which helps in defining Elasticsearch mappings.

Full-Text Search: The main challenge is searching across ingredients and instructions.

Filtering/Faceting: You can easily add filters for cuisine, diet, or cooking time ranges, which naturally leads to Elasticsearch aggregations.

Spring Data Elasticsearch: You'll learn how to use ElasticsearchRepository and define entities with @Document and @Field annotations, simplifying Elasticsearch interactions.

Core Features to Implement:

Recipe Ingestion:

A Spring Boot service to read recipe data from a file (JSON, CSV) and index it into Elasticsearch.

REST endpoint for manually adding a new recipe.

Search API:

A REST endpoint (/api/recipes/search) that accepts a search query.

Uses Elasticsearch to perform full-text search on recipe titles, ingredients, and instructions.

Returns relevant recipes.

Filtering/Faceting (Optional but Recommended for Learning):

Extend the search API to allow filtering by cuisine, dietary_tags (e.g., "vegetarian", "gluten-free"), or cooking_time range.

Implement aggregations to show available cuisines or tags along with counts (e.g., "Italian (50)", "Vegan (25)").

Recipe Details:

A REST endpoint (/api/recipes/{id}) to retrieve a single recipe by its ID.

Technical Stack:

Java 17+

Spring Boot 3.x: For rapid application development.

Spring Data Elasticsearch: Simplifies interaction with Elasticsearch.

Elasticsearch (and Kibana): For search and data visualization. (Use Docker for easy local setup!)

Maven or Gradle: For dependency management.

(Optional) Postman/Insomnia: For testing REST API endpoints.

(Optional) Simple Frontend: A basic HTML/JavaScript page or a simple React/Angular/Vue app to consume your Spring Boot API and display results.

Project Steps (High-Level):

Setup Spring Boot Project: Use Spring Initializr (start.spring.io) to create a new project with dependencies: Spring Web, Spring Data Elasticsearch, Lombok (optional but handy).

Configure Elasticsearch Connection: In application.properties or application.yml, configure your Elasticsearch host and port (e.g., spring.elasticsearch.uris=http://localhost:9200).

Define Recipe Entity: Create a Java POJO (e.g., Recipe.java) and annotate it with @Document, @Id, and @Field to define its mapping in Elasticsearch.
